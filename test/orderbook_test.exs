defmodule OrderBookTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Unit tests for the OrderBook module

  All test functions will return :empty if the respective book side is empty.
  Also, all test functions behave in respect to an orderbook Agent (require
  first arg to be agent pid).

  ## Testing
  - best_bid       :: float                  # return best (highest) bid
  - best_ask       :: float                  # return best (lowest) ask
  - apply_delta    :: 3tuple (Delta) -> None # apply a delta (:side, price, size)
                                               to the book
  - apply_snapshot :: [Delta] -> None        # clear books and apply a snapshot
                                               (list of deltas)
  - get_bids       :: [2tuple]               # gets the bids as a list
  - get_asks       :: [2tuple]               # gets the asks as a list
  - get_book       :: [[2tuple], [2tuple]]   # gets both the bid and ask lists

  # these will add the same price level to both sides since you do not replace
  # "data" with its tail after popping a level from it. is this expected?
  # not sure if it is possible to mutate data returned by setup_all.
  #
  # possible solution: have separate "data"s for bids and asks, such that
  # bid prices are in 0..999 and ask prices are in 1001..2000 (representing
  # say, a Â£2 spread). the volume can stay the same. this solves the above
  # peculiarity by making the test data more representative of a real-world
  # orderbook: if B and A are sets of current Bid and Ask prices, then by
  # definition their intersection would be empty and every element in B would
  # be less than every element in A,
