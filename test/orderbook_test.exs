defmodule OrderBookTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Unit tests for the OrderBook module

  All test functions will return :empty if the respective book side is empty.
  Also, all test functions behave in respect to an orderbook Agent (require
  first arg to be agent pid).

  ## Testing
  - best_bid       :: float                  # return best (highest) bid
  - best_ask       :: float                  # return best (lowest) ask
  - apply_delta    :: 3tuple (Delta) -> None # apply a delta (:side, price, size)
                                               to the book
  - apply_snapshot :: [Delta] -> None        # clear books and apply a snapshot
                                               (list of deltas)
  - get_bids       :: [2tuple]               # gets the bids as a list
  - get_asks       :: [2tuple]               # gets the asks as a list
  - get_book       :: [[2tuple], [2tuple]]   # gets both the bid and ask lists
