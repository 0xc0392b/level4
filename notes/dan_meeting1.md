# Meeting with Dan

## Overview

He seemed to pretty quickly grasp what the idea was, had some ideas for different approaches and emphasised
that we should read the material he sent in his initial reply.

## Ideas

- Use a caretaker process which is ontologically seperated from the main exchange-\>market-\>websocket tree
and can link (two way monitor) with many markets, exchanges etc. The caretaker contains all the logic for
correctly configing a market or websocket after it restarts.

- Recommends using the local or global name registries. Does make system more static but might sometimes be
a necessity (caretaker name static and registered at all times?).

- Read material given in the original email:
    + Chapter 8/9, Elixir in Action
    + https://adoptingerlang.org/docs/development/supervision\_trees/
